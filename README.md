# cvae

I implemented CVAE with chainer.
This method is  [Learning Structured Output Representation using Deep Conditional Generative Models][].
[Learning Structured Output Representation using Deep Conditional Generative Models]: https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5775-learning-structured-output-representation-using-deep-conditional-generative-models.pdf        "Learning Structured Output Representation using Deep Conditional Generative Models" (CVAE)

This code is partly based on [this][].

# Problem setting 
The goal of this of code is to generate the image using MINST dataset.
This setting is similar to the experiment conducted in Learning Structured Output Representation using Deep Conditional Generative Models.

# Procedures
python cvae_train.py  
python cvae_test.py
